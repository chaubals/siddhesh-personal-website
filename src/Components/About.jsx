                Hi, I'm Siddhesh "Sid" Chaubal, a passionate full-stack software
                developer.
              </p>
              <p className="fs-6">
                I am 25 years old and come from a middle-class family in Mumbai,
                India. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
                Engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, with a
                strong focus on web development. My primary interest lies in
                building scalable web applications and continuously improving my
                technical skills.
              </p>
              <p className="fs-6">
                I consider myself a solution-oriented individual. When faced
                with a challenge, I focus on solving the problem rather than
                getting discouraged. If I feel my skills are lacking, I quickly
                learn new concepts and practice until I am equipped to tackle
                the problem head-on.
              </p>
              <p className="fs-6">
                With an entrepreneurial mindset, I plan to leverage my skills to
                create a startup that integrates technology to solve real-world
                problems. Iâ€™m always excited to learn, grow, and make an impact.
